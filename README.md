## Where do I download ROMs and BIOS?

A: You have to dump the data from your legally owned system.

## Where do I put my ROMs?

A: Your ROMs are put into **sdmc:/tico/roms/<SYSTEM>**. [See here for supported ROIM formats.](https://ticoverse.com/wiki/library-and-roms/supported-rom-formats).

## What are Cores and how do I install them?

A: Cores are "plug-in"-emulators that know how to run certain games for the corresponding system. You can install the Cores via **Emulator** inside **Settings**.

## I cannot find Dolphin and GameCube!

A: You have to enable Dolphin under **Experimental**.

## My GameCube games run slow!

A: Try letting it sit idle once to compile shaders. If the game crashes, try a second time. The build is still in alpha.

## My PSX / Dreamcast / Sega devices won't run!

A: You need the proper BIOS file for the system and put them inside **sdmc:/tico/system/<SYSTEM>**.

## I get an SSL / SSH error when downloading Covers / Cores / etc.

A: Be sure that your time settings are correctly set to the current date/time.

## My ROMs are not being found?

A: Check your ROMs folder on your SD card. The file layout is supposed to look like this:

If it looks good, Rescan the games when you hover over the system and click on **Rescan Games**.
